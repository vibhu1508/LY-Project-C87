"""
Aden Hive Framework: A goal-driven agent runtime optimized for Builder observability.

The runtime is designed around DECISIONS, not just actions. Every significant
choice the agent makes is captured with:
- What it was trying to do (intent)
- What options it considered
- What it chose and why
- What happened as a result
- Whether that was good or bad (evaluated post-hoc)

This gives the Builder LLM the information it needs to improve agent behavior.

## Testing Framework

The framework includes a Goal-Based Testing system (Goal → Agent → Eval):
- Generate tests from Goal success_criteria and constraints
- Mandatory user approval before tests are stored
- Parallel test execution with error categorization
- Debug tools with fix suggestions

See `framework.testing` for details.
