"""Queen's ticket receiver entry point.

When a WORKER_ESCALATION_TICKET event is emitted on the shared EventBus,
this entry point fires and routes to the ``ticket_triage`` node, where the
Queen deliberates and decides whether to notify the operator.

Isolation level is ``isolated`` — the queen's triage memory is kept separate
from the worker's shared memory. Each ticket triage runs in its own context.
