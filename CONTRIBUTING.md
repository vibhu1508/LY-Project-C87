## Philosophy: Why We Build in the Open

Like Linux, TypeScript, and PSPDFKit, **Aden Hive is built by practitioners for practitioners**. We believe:

- **Quality over speed**: A well-tested feature beats a rushed release
- **Transparency over mystery**: Every decision is documented and reviewable
- **Community over ego**: The best idea wins, regardless of who suggests it
- **Performance matters**: Agents should be fast, efficient, and measurable
- **Cross-platform is non-negotiable**: If it doesn't work on Windows, macOS, and Linux, it's not done

Our goal is to deliver **developer success** through:
1. **Reliability** — Agents that work consistently across platforms
2. **Observability** — Clear insights into what agents are doing and why
3. **Extensibility** — Easy to add new tools, models, and capabilities
4. **Performance** — Fast execution with measurable metrics

---

## Issue Assignment Policy

To prevent duplicate work and respect contributors' time, we require issue assignment before submitting PRs.

### How to Claim an Issue

1. **Find an Issue:** Browse existing issues or create a new one
2. **Claim It:** Leave a comment (e.g., *"I'd like to work on this!"*)
3. **Wait for Assignment:** A maintainer will assign you within 24 hours. Issues with reproducible steps or proposals are prioritized.
4. **Submit Your PR:** Once assigned, you're ready to contribute

> **Note:** PRs for unassigned issues may be delayed or closed if someone else was already assigned.

### Exceptions (No Assignment Needed)

You may submit PRs without prior assignment for:
- **Documentation:** Fixing typos or clarifying instructions — add the `documentation` label or include `doc`/`docs` in your PR title to bypass the linked issue requirement
- **Micro-fixes:** Add the `micro-fix` label or include `micro-fix` in your PR title to bypass the linked issue requirement. Micro-fixes must meet **all** qualification criteria:

  | Qualifies | Disqualifies |
  |-----------|--------------|
  | < 20 lines changed | Any functional bug fix |
  | Typos & Documentation & Linting | Refactoring for "clean code" |
  | No logic/API/DB changes | New features (even tiny ones) |

---

## OS Support: Write Once, Run Everywhere

Aden Hive runs on **macOS, Windows, and Linux** with platform-specific optimizations.

### Current OS Support Matrix

| Feature | macOS | Windows | Linux | Notes |
|---------|-------|---------|-------|-------|
| Core Framework | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ | Fully tested |
| CLI Runner | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ | Platform-aware terminal handling |
| File Operations | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ | Atomic writes with ACL preservation (Windows) |
| Browser Automation | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ | Playwright-based |
| Process Spawning | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ | subprocess + asyncio |
| Credential Storage | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ | `~/.hive/credentials` |
| Web Dashboard | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ | React + FastAPI |

### Platform-Specific Code

**Windows Support** (`core/framework/credentials/_win32_atomic.py`)
- Uses `ReplaceFileW` API for atomic file replacement
- Preserves NTFS DACL (Discretionary Access Control Lists)
- Handles FAT32 vs NTFS volume detection

**macOS Support**
- Uses `open` command for browser launching
- Native terminal support with ANSI colors

**Linux Support**
- Uses `xdg-open` for browser launching
- Full systemd integration for daemon mode (future)

### Cross-Platform Best Practices

Use `pathlib.Path` for all file operations:

```python
from pathlib import Path

# ✅ Good: Cross-platform
config_path = Path.home() / ".hive" / "config.json"

# ❌ Bad: Unix-only
config_path = "~/.hive/config.json"
```

Use platform checks when needed:

```python
import sys
if sys.platform == "win32":
    # Windows-specific code
elif sys.platform == "darwin":
    # macOS-specific code
else:  # linux
    # Linux-specific code
```

### Priority Areas for OS Contributions

- [ ] **Windows WSL2 optimization** — Better detection and native integration
- [ ] **Linux systemd service** — Daemon mode for long-running agents
- [ ] **macOS app bundle** — `.app` distribution with proper sandboxing
- [ ] **Windows installer** — `.msi` or `.exe` installer with PATH setup
- [ ] **Docker images** — Official multi-arch images (amd64, arm64)

---

## Development Setup & Tooling

### Prerequisites

- **Python 3.11+** (3.12 or 3.13 recommended)
- **Git** for version control
- **uv** for package management (installed automatically by quickstart)
- **Node.js 18+** (optional, for frontend development)

> **Windows Users:**
> Native Windows is supported. Use `.\quickstart.ps1` for setup and `.\hive.ps1` to run (PowerShell 5.1+). Disable "App Execution Aliases" in Windows settings to avoid Python path conflicts. WSL is also an option but not required.

> **Tip:** Installing Claude Code skills is optional for running existing agents, but required if you plan to **build new agents**.

### Package Management with `uv`

`uv` is a fast Python package installer and resolver (replaces pip + venv):

```bash
# Install uv
curl -LsSf https://astral.sh/uv/install.sh | sh

# Install/sync dependencies
uv sync

# Add a new dependency
uv add <package>

# Run Python scripts
uv run python -m your_module

# Run pytest
uv run pytest
```

### Code Quality Tools

**ruff** — Fast Python linter and formatter (replaces black, isort, flake8)

```bash
# Format code
uv run ruff format .

# Check linting issues
uv run ruff check .

# Auto-fix linting issues
uv run ruff check . --fix
```

Configuration in `pyproject.toml`:
```toml
[tool.ruff]
line-length = 100
target-version = "py311"
```

### Makefile Targets

```bash
make lint          # Run ruff format + check
make check         # CI-safe checks (no modifications)
make test          # Run all tests
make test-tools    # Run tool tests only
make test-live     # Run live API integration tests (requires credentials)
```

### Recommended IDE Setup

**VS Code** (`.vscode/settings.json`)
```json
{
  "python.defaultInterpreterPath": "${workspaceFolder}/.venv/bin/python",
  "python.linting.enabled": true,
  "python.linting.ruffEnabled": true,
  "python.formatting.provider": "none",
  "[python]": {
    "editor.defaultFormatter": "charliermarsh.ruff",
    "editor.formatOnSave": true,
    "editor.codeActionsOnSave": {
      "source.fixAll": true,
      "source.organizeImports": true
    }
  }
}
```

**PyCharm**
- Enable ruff plugin
- Set Python interpreter to `.venv/bin/python`
- Enable pytest as test runner

## LLM Models & Providers

Aden Hive supports **100+ LLM providers** via LiteLLM, giving users maximum flexibility.

### Supported Providers

| Provider | Models | Notes |
|----------|--------|-------|
| **Anthropic** | Claude 3.5 Sonnet, Haiku, Opus | Default provider, best for reasoning |
| **OpenAI** | GPT-4, GPT-4 Turbo, GPT-4o | Function calling, vision |
| **OpenRouter** | Any OpenRouter catalog model | Uses `OPENROUTER_API_KEY` and `https://openrouter.ai/api/v1` |
| **Hive LLM** | `queen`, `kimi-2.5`, `GLM-5` | Uses `HIVE_API_KEY` and the Hive-managed endpoint |
| **Google** | Gemini 1.5 Pro, Flash | Long context windows |
| **DeepSeek** | DeepSeek V3 | Cost-effective, strong reasoning |
| **Mistral** | Mistral Large, Medium, Small | Open weights, EU hosting |
| **Groq** | Llama 3, Mixtral | Ultra-fast inference |
| **Ollama** | Any local model | Privacy-first, no API costs |
| **Azure OpenAI** | GPT-4, GPT-3.5 | Enterprise SSO, compliance |
| **Cohere** | Command, Command Light | Strong embeddings |
| **Together AI** | Open-source models | Flexible hosting |
| **Bedrock** | AWS-hosted models | Enterprise integration |

### Default Configuration

```python
# core/framework/llm/provider.py
DEFAULT_MODEL = "claude-haiku-4-5-20251001"
```

### Model Selection Guidelines

**For Production Agents**
- **Reliability**: Claude 3.5 Sonnet (best reasoning)
- **Speed**: Claude Haiku or GPT-4o-mini (fast responses)
- **Cost**: DeepSeek or Gemini Flash (budget-conscious)
- **Privacy**: Ollama with local models (no data leaves server)

**Provider-Specific Notes**
- **OpenRouter**: store `provider` as `openrouter`, use the raw OpenRouter model ID in `model` (for example `x-ai/grok-4.20-beta`), and use `OPENROUTER_API_KEY`
- **Hive LLM**: store `provider` as `hive`, use Hive model names such as `queen`, `kimi-2.5`, or `GLM-5`, and use `HIVE_API_KEY`

**For Development**
- Use cheaper/faster models (Haiku, GPT-4o-mini)
- Test with multiple providers to catch provider-specific issues
- Mock LLM calls in unit tests

### How to Add a New LLM Provider

1. **Check if LiteLLM supports it** (most providers already work out of the box)
2. **Add credential handling** in `core/framework/credentials/`
3. **Add provider-specific configuration** in `core/framework/llm/`
4. **Write tests** in `core/tests/test_llm_provider.py`
5. **Update documentation** in `README.md`, `docs/configuration.md`, and any setup guides that mention provider configuration

**Example: Testing LLM Integration**

```python
# core/tests/test_llm_provider.py
import pytest
from framework.llm.anthropic import AnthropicProvider

@pytest.mark.asyncio
async def test_anthropic_provider_basic():
    provider = AnthropicProvider(api_key="test_key", model="claude-3-5-sonnet-20241022")
    response = await provider.generate([{"role": "user", "content": "Hello"}])
    assert response.content
    assert response.model == "claude-3-5-sonnet-20241022"

@pytest.mark.live
@pytest.mark.asyncio
async def test_anthropic_provider_real(anthropic_api_key):
    """Live test with real API (requires credentials)"""
    provider = AnthropicProvider(api_key=anthropic_api_key)
    response = await provider.generate([{"role": "user", "content": "What is 2+2?"}])
    assert "4" in response.content
```

2. **Goal statement** — "Your job is to..."
3. **Step-by-step process** — Clear, numbered instructions
4. **Output format** — JSON schema or structured format
5. **Edge cases** — How to handle failures, missing data, etc.

**Example: High-Quality Agent Prompt**

```markdown
You are an elite Competitive Intelligence Analyst.

Your job is to monitor competitor websites, extract pricing and feature updates,
and produce a weekly intelligence report.

**STEP 1 — Discovery**
1. Use web_search to find the competitor's pricing page, changelog, and blog
2. Try queries like: "{competitor_name} pricing 2025"
3. If no results, navigate directly to their known domain

**STEP 2 — Extraction**
1. Use web_scrape on each relevant URL
2. Extract: pricing tiers, feature changes, announcement dates
3. Format as JSON: {competitor, category, update, source, date}

**STEP 3 — Analysis**
1. Compare current data with last week's snapshot (load_data)
2. Flag significant changes (>10% price change, new features)
3. Save current snapshot (save_data)

**STEP 4 — Reporting**
1. Generate HTML report with key highlights
2. Include comparison table and trend analysis
3. Call serve_file_to_user to deliver the report

**Important:**
- Be factual — only report what you actually see
- Skip URLs that fail to load
- Prioritize recent content (last 7 days)
```

### How to Contribute Sample Prompts

1. **Test your prompt** with a real agent first
2. **Document the use case** clearly
3. **Include expected tools** needed (web_search, save_data, etc.)
4. **Add to the appropriate category** in `/examples/recipes/sample_prompts_for_use_cases.md`
5. **Submit a PR** with title: `docs: add sample prompt for [use case]`

### Prompt Quality Checklist

- [ ] Role is clearly defined
- [ ] Steps are numbered and actionable
- [ ] Output format is specified (JSON schema preferred)
- [ ] Edge cases are handled (failures, missing data, rate limits)
- [ ] Tools are explicitly mentioned
- [ ] Tested with at least one real execution

### Priority Areas for Prompt Contributions

- [ ] **Industry-specific agents** — Healthcare, Legal, Finance, Education
- [ ] **Multilingual prompts** — Non-English agent templates
- [ ] **Error recovery patterns** — How agents should handle failures
- [ ] **Human-in-the-loop prompts** — When to ask for approval
- [ ] **Multi-agent coordination** — How agents delegate to sub-agents

## Performance Metrics & Benchmarking

**Performance is a feature.** Slow agents frustrate users. We measure everything.

### Key Performance Metrics

| Metric | Target | How to Measure |
|--------|--------|----------------|
| **Agent Latency** | <30s for simple tasks | `RuntimeLogger.log_execution_time()` |
| **LLM Token Usage** | <10K tokens/task | `LiteLLM.track_cost()` |
| **Tool Call Success Rate** | >95% | `ToolExecutor.success_rate()` |
| **Judge Accuracy** | >90% agreement with human | Manual evaluation |
| **Memory Usage** | <500MB per agent | `psutil.Process().memory_info()` |
| **Concurrent Agents** | 10+ agents on 4-core CPU | Load testing |

### Current Monitoring Tools

**Runtime Performance**
```python
# core/framework/runtime/runtime_logger.py
class RuntimeLogger:
    def log_node_execution(self, node_id: str, duration: float, tokens: int):
        # Tracks per-node performance
        pass

    def log_tool_call(self, tool_name: str, duration: float, success: bool):
        # Tracks tool latency and reliability
        pass
```

**LLM Cost Tracking**
```python
# LiteLLM automatically tracks cost per request
from litellm import completion_cost
cost = completion_cost(model="claude-3-5-sonnet-20241022", messages=[...])
```

**Monitoring Dashboard** (`/core/framework/monitoring/`)
- WebSocket-based real-time monitoring
- Displays: active agents, tool calls, token usage, errors
- Access at: `http://localhost:8000/monitor`

### How to Add Performance Metrics

**1. Instrument your code**
```python
import time
from framework.runtime.runtime_logger import RuntimeLogger

logger = RuntimeLogger()

start = time.time()
result = await expensive_operation()
duration = time.time() - start

logger.log_execution_time("expensive_operation", duration)
```

**2. Add tests with performance assertions**
```python
@pytest.mark.asyncio
async def test_agent_performance():
    start = time.time()
    result = await run_agent(...)
    duration = time.time() - start

    assert duration < 30.0, f"Agent took {duration}s (expected <30s)"
    assert result.total_tokens < 10000, f"Used {result.total_tokens} tokens (expected <10K)"
```

**3. Create benchmark scripts** (`/benchmarks/`)
```python
# benchmarks/bench_agent_latency.py
import asyncio
import statistics
from exports.my_agent import MyAgent

async def benchmark_agent(iterations: int = 100):
    durations = []
    for i in range(iterations):
        start = time.time()
        await MyAgent().run("test input")
        durations.append(time.time() - start)

    print(f"Mean: {statistics.mean(durations):.2f}s")
    print(f"P50: {statistics.median(durations):.2f}s")
    print(f"P99: {statistics.quantiles(durations, n=100)[98]:.2f}s")

asyncio.run(benchmark_agent())
```

### Performance Optimization Tips

**1. Reduce LLM Calls**
- Cache repetitive responses
- Use cheaper models for simple tasks (Haiku vs Sonnet)
- Batch multiple questions into one prompt

**2. Optimize Tool Calls**
- Run independent tool calls in parallel (`asyncio.gather`)
- Cache API responses when appropriate
- Use webhooks instead of polling

**3. Memory Management**
- Use streaming for large files (don't load entire file into memory)
- Clear conversation history periodically
- Use database for large datasets (not in-memory)

**4. Graph Execution**
- Minimize sequential dependencies (more parallelism)
- Use conditional edges to skip unnecessary nodes
- Set appropriate timeouts

### Priority Areas for Performance Contributions

- [ ] **Comprehensive benchmark suite** — Standard tasks across providers
- [ ] **Real-time performance dashboard** — Live monitoring during execution
- [ ] **Cost tracking per agent/workflow** — Budget management
- [ ] **Provider comparison dashboard** — Speed, quality, cost metrics
- [ ] **Automatic performance regression detection** — CI integration

## Code Style & Standards

### Project Structure

- `core/` - Core framework (agent runtime, graph executor, protocols)
- `tools/` - MCP Tools Package (tools for agent capabilities)
- `exports/` - Agent packages and examples
- `docs/` - Documentation
- `scripts/` - Build and utility scripts
- `.claude/` - Claude Code skills for building/testing agents

### Python Style Guidelines

- Use Python 3.11+ for all new code
- Follow PEP 8 style guide
- Add type hints to function signatures
- Write docstrings for classes and public functions
- Use meaningful variable and function names
- Keep functions focused and small
- **Line length**: 100 characters
- **Formatting**: Use `ruff format` (no manual formatting)
- **Linting**: Use `ruff check` (no warnings tolerated)

For linting and formatting (Ruff, pre-commit hooks), see [Linting & Formatting Setup](docs/contributing-lint-setup.md).

### Example: Good Code

```python
from typing import Optional
from pydantic import BaseModel

class AgentConfig(BaseModel):
    """Configuration for agent execution.

    Attributes:
        model: LLM model name (e.g., "claude-3-5-sonnet-20241022")
        max_tokens: Maximum tokens for completion (default: 4096)
        temperature: Sampling temperature 0.0-1.0 (default: 0.7)
    """
    model: str
    max_tokens: int = 4096
    temperature: float = 0.7

async def run_agent(config: AgentConfig, timeout: Optional[float] = None) -> dict:
    """Run an agent with the given configuration.

    Args:
        config: Agent configuration
        timeout: Optional timeout in seconds (default: no timeout)

    Returns:
        Dictionary containing agent results and metadata

    Raises:
        TimeoutError: If execution exceeds timeout
        ValueError: If config is invalid
    """
    # Implementation
    pass
```

### Architecture Principles

1. **Separation of concerns** — One class, one responsibility
2. **Dependency injection** — Pass dependencies explicitly (no global state)
3. **Async by default** — Use `async/await` for I/O operations
4. **Error handling** — Catch specific exceptions, log errors, fail gracefully
5. **Immutability** — Prefer immutable data structures (Pydantic models)

### Types of Tests

**Unit Tests** (80% of tests)
- Test individual functions/classes in isolation
- Fast (<1ms per test)
- No external dependencies (mock everything)
- Live in `/core/tests/` and `/tools/tests/`

**Integration Tests** (15% of tests)
- Test multiple components together
- Moderate speed (<1s per test)
- May use test databases or mock APIs
- Live in `/core/tests/integration/`

**Live Tests** (5% of tests)
- Test against real external APIs
- Slow (>1s per test)
- Require credentials
- Marked with `@pytest.mark.live` (skipped by default)

### Running Tests

> **Note:** When testing agents in `exports/`, always set PYTHONPATH:
>
> ```bash
> PYTHONPATH=exports uv run python -m agent_name test
> ```

```bash
# Run lint and format checks (mirrors CI lint job)
make check

# Run core framework tests (mirrors CI test job)
make test

# Or run tests directly
cd core && pytest tests/ -v

# Run tools package tests (when contributing to tools/)
cd tools && uv run pytest tests/ -v

# Run tests for a specific agent
PYTHONPATH=exports uv run python -m agent_name test

# Run specific test file
uv run pytest core/tests/test_graph_executor.py

# Run specific test function
uv run pytest core/tests/test_graph_executor.py::test_simple_execution

# Run with coverage
uv run pytest --cov=core --cov-report=html

# Run in parallel
uv run pytest -n auto

# Run live tests (requires credentials)
uv run pytest -m live

# Run only fast tests
uv run pytest -m "not live"
```

> **CI also validates** that all exported agent JSON files (`exports/*/agent.json`) are well-formed JSON. Ensure your agent exports are valid before submitting.

### Test Coverage Goals

- **Core framework**: >90% coverage
- **Tools**: >80% coverage (some tools are hard to mock)
- **Critical paths**: 100% coverage (graph execution, credential handling, LLM calls)

### Example: Writing Tests

**Unit Test**
```python
import pytest
from framework.graph.node import Node

def test_node_creation():
    node = Node(id="test", name="Test Node", node_type="event_loop")
    assert node.id == "test"
    assert node.name == "Test Node"
    assert node.node_type == "event_loop"

@pytest.mark.asyncio
async def test_node_execution():
    node = Node(id="test", name="Test Node", node_type="event_loop")
    result = await node.execute({"input": "test"})
    assert result["status"] == "success"
```

**Integration Test**
```python
import pytest
from framework.graph.executor import GraphExecutor
from framework.graph.node import Node

@pytest.mark.asyncio
async def test_graph_execution_with_multiple_nodes():
    nodes = [
        Node(id="node1", ...),
        Node(id="node2", ...),
    ]
    edges = [...]

    executor = GraphExecutor(nodes, edges)
    result = await executor.run({"input": "test"})

    assert result["status"] == "success"
    assert "node1" in result["executed_nodes"]
    assert "node2" in result["executed_nodes"]
```

**Live Test**
```python
import pytest
import os

@pytest.mark.live
@pytest.mark.asyncio
async def test_anthropic_real_api():
    """Test against real Anthropic API (requires ANTHROPIC_API_KEY)"""
    api_key = os.getenv("ANTHROPIC_API_KEY")
    if not api_key:
        pytest.skip("ANTHROPIC_API_KEY not set")

    provider = AnthropicProvider(api_key=api_key)
    response = await provider.generate([{"role": "user", "content": "What is 2+2?"}])

    assert "4" in response.content
```

## Troubleshooting

### `make: command not found`
Install `make` using:

```bash
sudo apt install make
```

### `uv: command not found`
Install `uv` using:

```bash
curl -LsSf https://astral.sh/uv/install.sh | sh
source ~/.bashrc
```

### `ruff: not found`
If linting fails due to a missing `ruff` command, install it with:

```bash
uv tool install ruff
```

### WSL Path Recommendation
When using WSL, it is recommended to clone the repository inside your Linux home directory (e.g., ~/hive) instead of under /mnt/c/... to avoid potential performance and permission issues.

### Test Failures
If tests fail locally but pass in CI:
1. Make sure you're using Python 3.11+
2. Run `uv sync` to ensure dependencies are up-to-date
3. Clear pytest cache: `rm -rf .pytest_cache`
4. Run tests in verbose mode: `pytest -vv`

## Final Thoughts

Building open-source software is a marathon, not a sprint. **Quality beats quantity.** We'd rather merge 10 well-tested, thoughtfully-designed features than 100 rushed, buggy ones.

As Peter Steinberger (PSPDFKit) says: *"The best code is code that doesn't exist."* Before adding a feature, ask:
- Is this really needed?
- Can we solve this with existing tools?
- Will users actually use this?
- Can we make it simpler?

As Linus Torvalds (Linux) says: *"Talk is cheap. Show me the code."* We value:
- Working code over lengthy discussions
- Tests over promises
- Documentation over assumptions
- Benchmarks over claims

As Anders Hejlsberg (TypeScript) says: *"Make it work, make it right, make it fast."* In that order:
- First, get it working (pass tests)
- Then, get it right (clean code, good design)
- Finally, get it fast (optimize hot paths only)
