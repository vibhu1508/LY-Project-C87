        Purpose
            Apply a structured diff to update a file while preserving context.

        When to use
            Larger but still controlled updates
            Refactoring structured memory (tables, sections)
            Automated compaction or cleanup passes

        Rules & Constraints
            Diff must be context-aware
            Rejected if it touches restricted sections
            Prefer apply_patch for small changes

        Args:
            path: The path to the file (relative to session root)
            diff_text: The diff patch text to apply
            workspace_id: The ID of the workspace
            agent_id: The ID of the agent
            session_id: The ID of the current session

        Returns:
            Dict with application status and patch results, or error dict
